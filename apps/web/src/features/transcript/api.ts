 * This called `/meetings/{id}/transcript`, a path no backend route had — the
 * two halves of one module had picked different shapes for the same call.
 *
 * **Not the live one.** Utterances are written in a single transaction when the
 * task finishes, so this returns nothing until the meeting is processed and
 * cannot show a recording as it happens. `audio.md` gives that to a live
 * channel that goes straight to the screen, "never through a contract or an
 * event", and that channel does not exist yet.
 *
 * `Utterance[]`, not `TranscriptReady`: that payload is the announcement A
 * publishes once, and a consumer is required to check
 * `privacy.original_audio_deleted` before touching it. A screen reading a
 * stored transcript is not that consumer. `Utterance` is still a contract type,
 * so no mirror is hand-written here.
