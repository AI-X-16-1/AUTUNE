# Module C. Gap Detection

| **Package** | `autune_gap` |
| **Owner** | 박재경 |
| **Backend** | `modules/gap/` |
| **Frontend** | `apps/web/src/features/gap/` |
| **Table prefix** | `gap_` |
| **API prefix** | `/api/gap` |

## Responsibility

Find what the meeting should have covered and did not. Build a topic graph from
the transcript, measure who participated in which topic, compare against a
domain template, and score the risk of each missing item.

## Non-goals

- Extracting what *was* said into action items — that is B.
- Connecting to past meetings — that is D. C works within one meeting.
- Predicting future misalignment — that is E.

## Inputs

| Source | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| A | `TranscriptReady` via `autune.transcript.ready` |
| `packages/core` | `meetings`, `participants`, `utterances` (read-only) |

## Outputs

| Destination | Contract | Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | `GapReport` | `autune.gap.completed` |
| Slack | Gap report and question cards | — |

## Pipeline

1. **NER** — spaCy extracts entities: features, systems, metrics, people, dates.
2. **Relation extraction** — build subject–relation–object triples, with LLM
   assistance for hard cases.
3. **Topic graph** — persist nodes and edges as rows (`gap_topics`,
   `gap_topic_edges`), then load them into NetworkX.
4. **Centrality** — PageRank and betweenness identify which topics carried the
   meeting.
5. **Participation matrix** — per topic, who spoke and who was silent.
6. **Template comparison** — match the meeting against a domain template and
   find unfilled items.
7. **Risk scoring** — score each gap using topic centrality, participation
   imbalance (a topic no engineer spoke on is riskier), and template weight.
8. **Question generation** — produce a concrete question that would close each
   gap.
9. **Publish** — emit `GapReport`.

## Storage

| Store | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL `gap_topics` | Topic nodes with centrality, per meeting |
| PostgreSQL `gap_gaps` | Detected gaps, category, severity, risk score, question |
| PostgreSQL `gap_participation` | Topic × participant speech presence |
| PostgreSQL `gap_templates` | Domain templates and their items |
| PostgreSQL `gap_topic_edges` | Relations between topics, per meeting |

Everything cascades from `meetings.id`, so no deletion hook is needed.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/reports/{meeting_id}` | Full gap report |
| GET | `/topics/{meeting_id}` | Topic graph for visualization |
| POST | `/gaps/{id}/dismiss` | Mark a gap as a false positive (feeds threshold tuning) |
| GET | `/templates` | Available domain templates |

## Celery tasks

| Task | Trigger | Queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autune.gap.on_transcript_ready` | `autune.transcript.ready` | `cpu_heavy` |

## Slack surface

- Gap report thread in the meeting channel, `high` severity only by default
- Generated question cards teams can act on

## AI stack

| Component | Model or algorithm |
| --- | --- |
| Entity extraction | spaCy NER (Korean model) |
| Relation extraction | Rule-based patterns plus LLM assistance |
| Graph | NetworkX, in memory |
| Topic importance | PageRank, betweenness centrality |
| Risk scoring | Weighted heuristic; thresholds in `config.py` |

## Metric

Gap detection precision — 0.70+ at six weeks, 0.82+ at three months.

Precision, not recall: a false gap costs user trust, a missed gap costs
nothing they did not already have. Only `high` severity is shown by default,
and dismissals feed threshold tuning.

```bash
uv run --package autune-gap python -m autune_gap.eval
```

## Privacy notes

- The participation matrix records **whether** a participant spoke on a topic,
  not how much. It is topic coverage, not speech volume — do not let it drift
  into a per-person talk-time metric. See `../architecture/privacy.md` section 3.
- Topic labels derived from transcript text are already masked upstream. Do not
  re-derive anything from an unmasked source; there is not one.

## The topic graph is per meeting

Decided 2026-09-08 (issue #23): C builds a fresh subgraph for each meeting and
does not accumulate across meetings.

Nothing C produces needs accumulation. Centrality answers "which topics carried
*this* meeting", the participation matrix and template comparison are
within-meeting by definition, and risk scoring feeds on all three. C's metric is
gap detection precision, which accumulation does not help.

What it avoids:

- **Two mechanisms answering the same question.** D already matches topics
  across meetings with SBERT, BM25 and cross-encoder re-ranking. A second,
  graph-based matcher would disagree with it, and users would see the
  contradiction.
- **Ambiguous centrality.** A topic central to today's meeting and a topic
  central to the quarter are different things; an accumulated PageRank measures
  the second while the gap report needs the first.
- **Surgical deletion.** Retention has to remove one meeting's data
  (`../architecture/privacy.md` section 4). Dropping a per-meeting subgraph is
  trivial; unpicking one meeting's contribution from a shared graph, where edges
  may be shared, is error-prone.

The dashboard's topic-recurrence figure (S26) does not need it either: D's
`topic_links` already say a topic came up before, so E counts those.

## Open questions

- How many domain templates for the MVP, and who authors them.
