"""Business logic for module E: Meeting Intelligence.

Owner: 이승환. See docs/modules/intelligence.md and ../../CLAUDE.md.

Reads shared entities from ``autune_core``; writes only ``intel_*`` tables.
Never imports another module.

This file holds the completion-tracking logic. E aggregates B, C and D; any of
them can fail, so aggregation runs when all three have reported or when a
timeout elapses. The Celery glue that enqueues the aggregate task lives in
``tasks.py`` — this module never imports a task.
